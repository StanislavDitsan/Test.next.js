This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## json-server

The command json-server --watch --port 4000 ./_data/db.json is used to start the json-server with specific options and configurations:

json-server: This is the command to run the json-server package.

--watch: This option tells json-server to watch for changes in the JSON file (db.json) and automatically reload the server if the file is modified.

--port 4000: This option specifies the port number (4000 in this case) on which json-server will run and listen for incoming HTTP requests.

./_data/db.json: This is the path to the JSON file (db.json) that contains the data you want json-server to serve as a RESTful API.
